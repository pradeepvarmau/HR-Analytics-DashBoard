## Overview

This repository contains a Human Resources (HR) Analytics project developed using Power BI. HR analytics is a crucial aspect of modern business management, allowing organizations to gain insights into their workforce and make informed decisions to optimize operations, improve employee satisfaction, and drive business success.

In this project, we utilize Power BI, a powerful business analytics tool, to analyze HR data and extract valuable insights. By visualizing key metrics and trends, stakeholders can gain a deeper understanding of various aspects related to human resources, such as employee demographics, performance, retention, and engagement.

- **Data Analysis**: Perform in-depth analysis of HR data to uncover patterns, trends, and correlations.
- **Dashboard Interactivity**: Enable users to interact with the dashboards, drill down into specific data points, and filter information dynamically.
- **Employee Performance Metrics**: Track and visualize key performance indicators (KPIs) related to employee performance and productivity.
- **Employee Engagement**: Measure employee engagement levels and identify factors influencing employee satisfaction.
- **Attrition Analysis**: Analyze factors contributing to employee turnover and develop strategies for retention.
- **Predictive Analytics**: Explore predictive modeling techniques to forecast future HR trends and outcomes.
